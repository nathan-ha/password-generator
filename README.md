# Generate easy-to-remember passwords

By easy-to-remember, I mean that it is something that you can say out loud. If it sounds like a word instead of a bunch of random letters, then hopefully you have less trouble remembering it.


These passwords will follow some rules to accomplish this:

note: if you want to have a more secure password, I suggest manually placing special characters/numbers in the middle of the password. I don't do it in the code because I don't know how to make it look nice

1. Consonants will be followed by vowels, unless you have two of the same consonants in a row. More exceptions are listed on #5-7.
2. Vowels will be followed by consonants, but sometimes you can have two vowels in a row.
3. By default, the first letter will be capitalized and special characters and numbers will be inserted at the end of the password.
4. Dashes (-) will be placed randomly placed throughout the password. There won't always be one. There cannot be consecutive dashes.
5. A 'c' may be followed by a 'k' if the 'c' follows a vowel (e.g. ack).
6. An 'h' may follow a consonant, but not another 'h'.
7. An 'L' may follow a consonant, unless it there is already a consonant followed by an 'l' (e.g. cannot have 'pacll', but 'pacl' is fine.)
